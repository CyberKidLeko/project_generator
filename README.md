JavaScript Project Prompt Generator

Scope
This project is a command-line tool designed to inspire developers with unique and randomized JavaScript project ideas. By combining elements from three categories—project type, feature idea, and target audience—the program generates creative prompts to kickstart development.

Project Objectives
Build a fully functional random project generator using JavaScript.
Learn and apply Git for version control.
Develop and test the program locally using the command line.
Provide a simple and customizable tool for developers to expand their skills or find inspiration.
Features
Randomized project prompts based on three categories.
Easily expandable arrays for more data.
Lightweight and fast command-line execution.
Beginner-friendly implementation for JavaScript learners.
How It Works
Randomization: The program uses JavaScript's Math.random() to select random elements from pre-defined arrays.
Output: Outputs a complete sentence describing a project idea.
Example Output
Build a portfolio builder for teachers that includes animated transitions.
Build an interactive game for remote workers that includes multi-language support.

Setup Instructions
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd message-generator
```
Run the program:

```
Project Scope
The program aims to:

Provide a fun and practical tool for developers.
Help users practice JavaScript fundamentals, including arrays, functions, and randomization.
Serve as a foundation for building more complex applications, such as a web-based project idea generator.
Future Improvements
Add user input to filter prompts by specific categories (e.g., "Only show ideas for e-commerce platforms").
Expand functionality with a web-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Integrate with APIs to pull fresh data for project types, features, or audiences.
Implement a save feature to keep a history of generated prompts.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with new features or additional prompt ideas.
